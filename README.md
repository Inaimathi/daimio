# Daimio is for lovers

Daimio is a framework for making programmable applications. (Mostly web ones for now.)

To get started drop this repo into a web-accessible directory. Then point your browser at
- tests/daimio.html
- demos/automata/excitebikes.html
- demos/goodideas.html

You'll need a copy of CodeMirror installed to prevent the test page from complaining. 

Please let me know which things explode. There's a lot of explosions right now. 

Thanks for trying Daimio!
