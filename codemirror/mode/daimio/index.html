TODOS:

-- Esc autocomplete for methods and param names and pvals
-- space to a/c
-- make a single-line version
- add space after a/c'ing
- always-on a/c
- upward a/c
- console area
- searchable history
- use the real daimio parser
- allowed editing of files [db?]
- a/c aliases
- run selected in repl from textarea
- select outward 

- list of tech
  - code editor
  - viz editor
  - good ideas
  - analysis
  - sharable
  - saveable (db)

{noun find
^ _this.out-edges | add _this.in-edges
^_^ ^0 | map block ^1}

{^ _memo | add _this ^_^ range 100 | reduce block ^1}
{range 100 | reduce block "{_memo | add _this}"}

Fixed:
{begin x | sort}y{begin _y}z{end _y}{end z}{end x}  -- blocks have special syntax, anon blocks, bad ends are errors
{// comments | hey now //}  --- fix terminators n' comments
{mfoo foo baz}  --- foo and baz should be errors
{"<a href="malarky">foo</a>"}  --- quotes in angle brackets don't count
{/()} {/(} outside {/)}  --- broken lists bork lights

{@foo.x} read from channel

^0 gives lift input?

client-side gui 'walk-back' control... like, ^b goes backward through windows and examples and selections and whatnot. not really undoing, more like redoing the gui operations in reverse. unwinding, maybe. ^z would still properly undo things (but might not have the gui unwinding effects, since ^z only walks the event log, which is only for persistent actions). (also, how does ^b avoid undoing actions? maybe it's a short-term queue that only stores recent things -- a selection doesn't make sense once that bit of code changes.)
anyway, we record these events (even soft ones like unwinding the gui, although that doesn't persist). and when we go backward and then forward again, overwriting our earlier changes, you can think of that as creating a new branch, but you could also think of it as creating a 'loop', where we connect the last non-undone event and the first post-undoing event: a tesseract, or code folding trick to skip those intermediate steps. they're still there on the event log, and we can walk into them if we want, but in general we 'fold over' and skip the do/undo steps.
[it makes kind of a boomerang shape, the doing/undoing, since the undos are the reverse of the dos. hence code folding. can we detect this and do it at the interface layer, or does it have to be stored in the log? i think it can be detected, maybe... although marking the undos could be good anyway.]



Some external strings. Someday, a <em>test</em> of mixed mode editing.
{mfoo foo}
{math foo x 123}
{math round value 101.01}
{math round value 101.01 x :foo}
{math round value 101.01 to 2}
{math round value 101.01 x :foo to 2}

{math round 
  value 101.01 to 2}

{:xyzzy}
{"xyzzy"}
{"xyzzy
  xyx"}

1 {2} 3
1 {/asdf asdf} 3
1 {/asdf 
    asdf} 3

Also external.

{(1 2 3)}
{(1 2 (3))}
{(1 2 {list pair data (1 2 3 4)} )}
{(1 2 {list pair data (1 2 3 4)} ) | list union}

{* (1 2 3 :foo :baz)}

{story find
^ sort by :date | slice 10
^ sort by :tags
  // A comment terminator
  ^^ filter block "{:foo | is in this.tags}"
  ^^ filter block "{:baz | is in this.tags}"
  ^^ filter block "{:xyz | is in this.tags}"
  ^__^ (^_1 ^_2 ^_3) // you could skip this line w/o change
^ filter block "{(:foo :baz :xyz) | list intersect data this.tags | not}"
^_^ union (^_1 ^_2) | diff ^_3 | @> :lalala}

{story find by_ids #id
^ sort by :date | reverse | slice 10
^ sort by :tags | slice 20
^_^ if #sort | is like :tags | then ^_2 else ^_1
} {// note laziness -- the lifted pipelines are actually blocks //}

Destructuring:
{(1 2 3) | >(:a :b :c)}

these are equal:
{* (:k1 2 :k2 4 :k3 8) | >(:a :b :c)}
{* (:k1 2 :k2 4 :k3 8) | >{* (:k2 :b :k1 :a :k3 :c)}}

Also:
{({* (:k1 2 :k2 4 :k3 8)} {* (:k1 14 :k2 18 :k3 116)}) | __.(:k2 :k3)}
  ((4 8) (18 116))... er. no, not quite.


maybe lifts can do this:
{verb find
^ sort by :name | group by "{__.name | string truncate length 1}"
^ __._id | sort order :desc
^_^ merge}
And the ^1 is piped as merge's first param, and ^2 is piped as the second.

{rule change_ham id @mech_rr ham {
  @pf.primerule.#1
  ^double __
    ^^ __.#1
      ^^^ is like "*" | then @pq_st_ids

      ^___^ ^1 | else ^2 | else ()

      ^^^ is like "*" | then @rule_st_ids
      ^^^ list filter data @rule_st_ids
      ^___^ ^1 | else ^2 | else ()
    // alternate take below. could munge above like 'each (@pq_st_ids @rule_st_ids)' etc. 
    // using lifts this way requires copy on lift entry, since the incoming value is ref'd multiple times.
    // this does not really read or write simpler than using temp vars... 
    // but maybe the control flow read is nicer? like right-to-left on the graph?
    // oy. really, this is not seeming to help. redo?
    ^^ __.#2 | is like "*" | then @rule_st_ids 
    | else "{@pf.primerule.#1.#2 | list filter data @rule_st_ids}"
    | else ()
    ^__^ (^1 ^2) | list union
  ^bigstar @rule_st_ids | else @pq_st_ids
  ^self __
  ^_^ ^self | is like "*" | then ^bigstar else ^double}

        (

          | else ()
          }
          {@pf.primerule.#1.#2 | is like "*" | then @rule_st_ids 
          | else "{@pf.primerule.#1.#2 | list filter data @rule_st_ids}"
          | else ()
          }
        ) | list union"}
| then "" else "Invalid ham "}


// can we curry over this, like:
{"{my set for @user_id in :profiles}"
| apply values (
    {* (:path :firstname value #firstname)}
    {* (:path :lastname value #lastname)}
    etc...
)}


or maybe 
{process apply over block on (:path :value) values (:firstname #firstname :lastname #lastname)}

maybe ^_^ keeps lifted sections as blocks, and ^_- runs each once in 'parallel' and pushes the results into ^_1 etc. so you can use them as blocks, lazily, in if/then/else etc, or use one multiple times as a template with different env state, but you can also just make a bunch of calls to e.g. the server (though if sending to a single server then just sending a single compound D block is much faster)
