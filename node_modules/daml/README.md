# DAML is for lovers

**DAML.js** is a parser for the DAML language. With DAML your application's functionality and the user's ability to access that functionality are disjointed, enabling your users to enable themselves to build tools to solve problems directly on your website. Plus, you can ride magic ponies and stuff. Also makes a mean templating language, if that's all you need.
